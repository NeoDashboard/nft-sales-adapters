## Testing

Before opening pull request make sure that your provider
passed the test.

Tests can be run by running command:
```
Pattern:
> npm run test [adapter name]

Example:
> npm run test okx-ethereum-1
```

If tests were **not passed**, the process will crash with
details.\
If tests were **passed**, process will print message `Tests were passed`.
